"""Post-build resolver for PHP/Rust scoped calls and receiver-typed calls.

Tree-sitter extraction records a scoped/static call such as ``Mailer::send($x)``
(PHP) or ``Mailer::send(x)`` / ``Self::new()`` (Rust) as a ``CALLS`` edge whose
target is the intermediate ``Class::method`` string.  That string matches
neither the canonical node key (``<file>::Class.method``) nor a bare method
name, so ``callers_of``, ``get_impact_radius`` and ``tests_for`` never see the
edge and report zero callers for a method that is obviously being called
(GitHub #567).

PHP instance calls keep their historical bare method target during parsing.
When a local receiver was directly constructed (``$x = new Type(); $x->run()``),
the parser stores the class as ``extra.receiver_scope`` and this pass uses that
evidence to resolve the call without changing parse-only output (GitHub #745).

This module runs after the graph is built and rewrites the resolvable
``Class::method`` targets to the canonical qualified name of the defined
method node, in the same style as the ReScript resolver.

It is deliberately conservative so it never fabricates an edge:

* Only genuine ``Class::method`` targets are considered; already-resolved
  targets (``<file>::Class.method``) are left alone.
* ``self`` / ``static`` (PHP) and ``self`` / ``Self`` (Rust) resolve to the
  enclosing class/type of the caller.
* A target resolves when exactly one ``(class, method)`` node exists in the
  graph, or when the caller file's ``IMPORTS_FROM`` edges disambiguate between
  several same-named definitions.
* Ambiguous or unknown targets (external types such as ``Vec::new`` or
  ``Redis::get`` with no in-graph definition) are left untouched, keeping the
  behaviour of unresolved external calls exactly as it is today.

Rewritten edges are tagged ``confidence_tier = INFERRED`` to distinguish a
heuristically resolved scoped call from a directly-extracted one.

Language notes:

* PHP scopes are namespace-qualified (``App\\Mail\\Mailer``) and PHP keywords
  are case-insensitive, so ``self`` / ``static`` (any case) mean the enclosing
  class.
* Rust scoped calls come through as ``::``-joined path segments.  Only genuine
  two-segment ``Type::method`` targets are resolved; multi-segment module paths
  (``crate::mailer::Mailer::new``) are left alone because resolving them by
  their last two segments would point at an unrelated type.  ``Self`` (the
  associated-function receiver) resolves to the enclosing type, while lowercase
  ``self`` is a *module* path — never a type — so it is not resolved here.
