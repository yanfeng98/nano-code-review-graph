[code-review-graph] Knowledge graph is available.

When answering questions about this codebase, prefer using the code-review-graph MCP tools before scanning files manually:
- Use semantic_search_nodes_tool to find classes, functions, or types by name or keyword.
- Use query_graph_tool with patterns like callers_of, callees_of, imports_of, importers_of, children_of, tests_for, inheritors_of, or file_summary to explore relationships.
- Use get_impact_radius_tool to understand the blast radius of changes.
- Use get_review_context_tool for token-efficient review context.
- Fall back to Grep/Glob/Read only when the graph does not cover what you need.

This saves significant tokens by avoiding full codebase scans.
